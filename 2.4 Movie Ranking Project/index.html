<h1>Yash's Recommendations</h1>
<h2>3 movies I want to watch</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spider Man into the SpiderVerse</h3>
<p>
  The previous movie was a banger and the trailer <br />
  looked sick. I mean it's the mulitverse <br />
  and time travel. exciting!
</p>
<h3>Black Panther</h3>
<p>
  The previous movie was good. <br />
  Looking forward to this one.
</p>
<h3>Thor: Love & Thunder</h3>
<p>
  The recent movies of Thor were good. <br />
  In this maybe they overdid the comedy a little bit <br />
  but it's still enjoyable.
